</p>
                      <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Job seekers often struggle to prepare effectively for interviews and create standout resumes that catch the attention of employers. Traditional methods of interview practice can be time-consuming and lack personalized feedback, while resume writing can be complex and generic, failing to highlight key qualifications for specific job opportunities. Additionally, many job seekers lack access to personalized career advice that could enhance their overall profile and job application strategy. There is a clear need for a streamlined, interactive solution that offers targeted interview practice, tailored resume reviews, and expert career guidance to improve job-seeking outcomes.

                        <h2>Impact</h2>
                        <ol>
<p>The difficulty users faced in discovering the interview simulation section has led to increased frustration and decreased satisfaction with the CareerCraft app. When users are unable to easily locate this core feature, it impairs their ability to fully engage with the app’s primary offering—AI-powered interview practice. This issue not only diminishes the app's overall utility but also restricts users' opportunities to improve their interview skills and advance their careers. Consequently, the navigation challenges contribute to a less favorable user experience, potentially deterring users from exploring other features and fully utilizing the app’s capabilities.
</p>

                        </ol>
                        <h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>To address these issues, the immediate focus will be on redesigning the app's navigation to make the interview simulation section more visible and accessible. This can be achieved by implementing clearer labels, intuitive menu structures, and ensuring that the section is prominently placed on the main dashboard. Additionally, onboarding tutorials or tooltips will be introduced to guide users to essential features, including the interview simulations, during their initial use of the app. To further enhance feature discoverability, a search functionality or a comprehensive “Help” section will be added, allowing users to quickly find and access key tools. Ongoing user feedback will be gathered to continuously refine the interface and address any new or persistent issues. Lastly, developing in-app guidance and support materials will help users navigate the app more effectively, ensuring they can make the most of its career development features.
